# Getting Good at Git

Tips and tricks learned using Git every day.

## Commit to New Branch
- If we have changes or new file
- We can use the command `git checkout -b <new branch>` to create a new branch
- The uncommited changes we have made go with us
- Then we `git add` the files
- And `git commit -m "<Brief description of commit>"` the added files
- This branch is not on the repository yet, so we use `git push` to push the branch into it
