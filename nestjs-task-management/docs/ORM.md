# Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database, using an object-oriented paradigm.

There are many ORM libraries that allow developers to communicate to the database using their preferred programming language - rather than sending plain queries directly.

## Pros and Cons of using an ORM library

There are pros and cons of using and ORM library.

### Pros
- Writing the data model in one place - easier to maintain. Less repetition.
- Lots of things done automatically - database handling, data types, relations etcetera.
- No need to write SQL syntax (easy to learn, hard to master). Using your natural way of coding.
- Database abstraction - you can change the database type whenever you wish.
- Leverages OOP, therefore things like inheritance are easy to achieve.

### Cons
- You have to learn it, and ORM libraries are not always simple.
- Performance is alright, but it's easy to neglect.
- Makes it easy to forget (or never learn) what's happening behind the scenes, which can lead to a variety of maintainability issues.
