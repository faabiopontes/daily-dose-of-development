# Seasons App

Learning about Class-Bases Components while we develop a app that gets the user location and their current month and display info related to the current season

## App Challenges
  - Need to get users physical location
  - Need to determine the current month
  - Need to change text and styling based on location + month

## Functional Components
  - Good for simple content

## Class-Bases Components
  - Good for just about everything else
  - Easier code organization
  - Can use 'state' (another React system)
  - Understands lifecycle events
  - Easier to handle user input
  - Easier to do things when the app first starts
