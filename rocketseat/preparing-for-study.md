- Use available time in the best way
- Define our objectives

## Learning Techniques

- Make notes
- Learning is a process
- Trust the method, don't jump steps
- The theory is formed through practice
- First understand what's happening, then write code
- Control the anxiety, even most during this pandemic time

## Consolidating Knowledge

- Watching classes is not enough
- Making notes we improve our learning process

- Build personal projects

## Obtain Career Results

- Put all your projects on Github
- Constant learning and evolution
- Give a cool description to your projects
- LinkedIn is the most important platform to connect developers and recruiters
- Post weekly on LinkedIn about our learnings
- Help other developers
- Watch "CEO Mentorships"
